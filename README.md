# PacmanAI
![](https://ai.berkeley.edu/images/pacman_game.gif)
## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. 
I implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
## Goals
focused on Search Algorithms, modelling Problem States & Heuristic Functions
  - DFS
  - BFS
  - Uniform Cost
  - A* Search
  - modelling starting state, goal state check, creating successor states
  - Implementing a Heuristic Function
